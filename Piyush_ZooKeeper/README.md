There are many animals in the zoo, and all of them need care. The animals must be fed, cleaned, surrounded by their kin, and kept happy. That is a difficult task for our large zoo, so one of your employers has suggested a more convenient way to keep track of everything. She wants to be able to pull up a video feed of any animal in the zoo with the help of a program. Being able to check on each habitat would help the zookeepers take care of our furry friends more efficiently!


Just enter a number (here it points to a specific habitat) to pull a video feed of that animal.
Just in case you wish to no longer see the animals, enter 'exit'.

Enjoy Zoo-Keeping!
